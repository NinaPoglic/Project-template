## Abstract 
<!-- (50-60 words) -->

## Research Questions
1. Do they sleep 12 hourse?
2. How much time do they spent moving around?

## Results / products
We find informations about wild pigs sleeping around 12 hours and were wondering if it is true.

## Data
<!-- What data will you use? Will you require additional context data? Where do you get this data from? Do you already have all the data? -->

## Analytical concepts

<!-- Which analytical concepts will you use? What conceptual movement spaces and respective modelling approaches of trajectories will you be using? What additional spatial analysis methods will you be using? -->

## R concepts
readr        
dplyr      
ggplot2    
sf           
terra        
lubridate
tidyverse
<!-- Which R concepts, functions, packages will you mainly use. What additional spatial analysis methods will you be using? -->

## Risk analysis
<!-- What could be the biggest challenges/problems you might face? What is your plan B? -->

## Questions? 

<!-- Which questions would you like to discuss at the coaching session? -->
