## Abstract 
<!-- (50-60 words) -->

## Research Questions
1. Do they sleep 12 hourse?
2. How much time do they spent moving around?

## Results / products
We found informations about wild pigs sleeping around 12 hours and were wondering if this is true. We are assuming that this is the case and that we will find this movement pattern after our analysis.

## Data
We will use Wild boar data. We believe that no additinal context data will be needed.
<!-- What data will you use? Will you require additional context data? Where do you get this data from? Do you already have all the data? -->

## Analytical concepts
- Movement spaces: continuous movement spaces
- Properties of the movement: non-limited, active
- Perspective of observation: Lagrange (GPS)


<!-- Which analytical concepts will you use? What conceptual movement spaces and respective modelling approaches of trajectories will you be using? What additional spatial analysis methods will you be using? -->

## R concepts
readr        
dplyr      
ggplot2    
sf           
terra        
lubridate
tidyverse
<!-- Which R concepts, functions, packages will you mainly use. What additional spatial analysis methods will you be using? -->

## Risk analysis
<!-- What could be the biggest challenges/problems you might face? What is your plan B? -->

## Questions? 

<!-- Which questions would you like to discuss at the coaching session? -->
